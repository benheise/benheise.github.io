# Cult of Personality problem or lack of eating our own dogfood?

> “I know your anger, I know your dreams, I've been everything you want to be. I'm the cult of personality.” -Living Colour, 1988

Infosec is staffed by humans, and humans tend to see reflected in their leaders and role models what they each see in themselves. This psychological identity of categorizing your own “Self” image is one of the tools used by Social Engineers (SE) to manipulate other humans, and can be one “exploit” used to manipulate a person. Chris Hadnagy referenced this concept when he wrote “As a social engineer, you must establish that you are a **part of the target tribe** before you can even begin building rapport. A tribe is what identifies a certain group -- maybe it is a style of clothing, a group task, an attitude, or a shared interest. The commonality among the members of the group creates the “tribe.” ” (“Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking”, p.103). Chris later goes on to define Rapport as “Building a bridge for communication based on trust and common interests”. (“Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking”, p.105)

These concepts are used by manipulators to establish a relationship, whether in the infosec community or in other communities. That network of relationships can be used as both a positive and negative mechanism. Some examples include positively, by using established relationships to weave the appearance of belonging as a member of that tribe or helping to connect people with other people within the community. This toolset can also be used negatively by wielding that network as peer pressure to influence people for or against certain concepts, causes, people, or interests that the manipulator aligns themselves with.

Those of you familiar with the study of SE are already familiar with these concepts and more. I include these examples here as context for the main point of this post: Manipulators who (ab)use these concepts and tools given to them to gather influence within the infosec community, while using these same concepts to protect their own “image” within the community.

With this context, let’s examine a specific case study of the patterns of behavior by one prominent person in the infosec community that leverages these tools of social manipulation for his own ends. These are examples that I personally am aware of, however others may exist.

1. Gatekeeping [2][#2]: A new woman to infosec had asked if she could be featured on an episode of a positivity focused community podcast that aimed to feature both known infosec contributors as well as highlighting newcomers. He felt that she had insufficient experience and made every effort to block her appearance. “She’s been here for what, a year? and she thinks she knows anything? Fuck her.” This behavior is curious as he himself is a relative newcomer to the infosec community, only becoming involved himself in the last couple of years. This newcomer had apparently not met his own standards for being highlighted as a part of a community that has professed efforts to welcome new minorities to the community. He successfully used his influence to block her appearance on that podcast.
2. Poor handling of rejection and gaslighting: When he related that his efforts to build rapport were rejected by a prominent infosec woman who works out and is recognized for being proficient with swords, he later stated about her: “What a barbarian” in a tone that was clearly not flattering or complimentary to the woman. When I later asked what he meant by this, he tried to gaslight my recollection of his statement by stating “Oh no, you are remembering wrong, I was just complimenting her about her physique. She's so strong, what a barbarian! I wouldn’t say anything mean about her.” Gaslighting[3][#3] is a technique commonly used by manipulators and abusers to change someone's recalled memory of a past event by creating doubt about the accuracy of their own memory.
3. Denigrating a peer: When a fellow community member’s book was met with success and acclaim, he privately remarked that “Look at (author’s name), he’s become one of those infosec rockstars that he has always criticized.” (paraphrased). Publicly, this person still showers the author with positive comments and sentiment and retains a positive relationship with the author.
4. Potential racism: When the topic of inviting a prominent infosec leader who is a Person of Color to contribute to a positivity oriented, community focused podcast, he stated: “If you invite (them) on (the podcast) then I absolutely will not be there.

I've decided not to include numerous other examples of behavior due to the knowledge being third hand and unverified.

Within our community are several people who use the title of SE, and as with any spectrum of humans, not all SEs are using this SE skillset in harmful ways. The best defense I’ve been able to find is to make yourself and others aware of the tactics that SEs use by reading and studying available materials on the topic. Don’t just take people at their word, but deliberate on their “patterns of behavior” over time to make your own evaluation. This awareness toolset applies to both professional SEs, as well as abusive spouses and other manipulators of people. 

One concept that women have created in order to share information and raise awareness about abusers and manipulators to peers within the community without fear of reprisal is a “Whisper Network.”[4][#4] Whisper Networks are “an informal chain of information passed privately between women. It is typically a list of powerful people in an industry alleged as being sexual harassers or abusers.”

Awareness of these techniques seem to be why manipulators prefer to work privately in non-public forums, talking “behind the back” of the subject in order to control or manipulate perceptions about that subject. By “Controlling the narrative” in this private manner, the manipulator can ensure that the person they are trying to manipulate arrives at the manipulator’s desired state. The manipulator can either spread outright lies about conversations and events that happened privately, or "frame" certain details and twist facts to their suit own ends.

To close this out: In dealing with a manipulator, you control the information that is shared with them directly, however you as with social networks, you cannot control information shared with them indirectly. They will attempt to elicit information from you or others that can be used to leverage influence with yourself or others. Arm yourself and be cognizant of techniques that manipulators use in order to influence humans. Recognize the hooks that are used, and the emotions that are solicited in order to influence you and others. Realize when they are attempting to use you and your responses in order to manipulate others.
